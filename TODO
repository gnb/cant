x  modify task_execute() to run all jobs at tasks marked barriers
x  organise to mark most tasks as barriers!
x  automatic shim and/or ptrace based dependency information
   generation, saving, and feeding into job scheduling.  Controlled
   from xtaskdef *somehow*
x  Dep information should have a `quality' factor applied to it,
   which is used to help judge what to do when things go wrong.
   Explicit dep information in the build file is the highest Q,
   automatic dep info from xtask depmappers next best, current
   (source file not more recent than dep info) extracted deps
   next best, and noncurrent extracted deps worst.
x  job scheduling should handle transitive nature of Java compiles;
   should check mod times for all immediate upstream jobs and set
   state accordingly.
x  start job worker threads on demand, i.e. when a job is runnable,
   the start queue is full, and there are less than the maximum
   number of worker threads, start another.
