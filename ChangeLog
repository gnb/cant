	* Release 0.0.6

	* Xtaskdefs are now per-project instead of global.
	* Projects can inherit taskdefs and properties from parent projects.
	All projects inherit from a global project read from globals.xml.

	* Improvements to argument parsing: added some GNU-style options.
	* Added --verbose option which prints commands instead of log messages.
	* Added --version option.
	* Mentioned --help in its own output.
	
	* Added --enable-debug to configure script.

	* Centralised code for handling "if" and "unless" attributes on
	various elements, so its now done cleanly and consistently.
	* Added "matches", "matchesregex" and "matchsensitive" attributes to
	conditionals, to allow conditionals to be more finely tuned.
	* Actually implemented conditionals on targets.

	* Centralised reporting of unknown and missing required attributes
	during buildfile parse.

	* Fileset_t interface now const correct.
	* Props_t interface now const-correct.
	* Provided a const-correct pattern_match_c(); the downside is that
	it doesn't support groups.

	* Fileset_t's still read includes and excludes files every time
	they're queried, but now they don't pointlessly store the data
	between queries.
	* Fileset_t's now get a props_t to expand variables at the latest
	possible time (i.e. fileset_apply()) instead of at creation,
	which solves some variable scope problems with xtasks.
	* Added fileset_gather_mapped() based on some code from xtask.c
	* Removed fileset_gather() which was not used.

	* Extended log interface to allow log messages to be saved for
	later emission.
	* Log messages for delayed jobs now display correct scope.
	* Renamed logperror() log_perror().
	
	* Split off various new headers from cant.h

	* Moved target execution code to target.c.
	
	* The <delete> task will admit to its presence even if the verbose
	attribute is off.
	
	* Made xtask_arg_t data structure cleaner.
