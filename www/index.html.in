<P>
CANT is a C implementation of the Apache/Jakarta project's
ANT build tool, which uses a modern-style XML file format to build
Java projects.  Unlike ANT, CANT is written in C and intended
for building C programs.  CANT is intended to be a replacement
for GNU <I>make</I> and GNU <I>automake</I>.
</P>

<P>
Currently, CANT is in a very early stage of development.  You
probably can't yet do useful work with CANT.
</P>

<P>
CANT's features include:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>XML file `format', easy to read and write.  No tab weirdness!
  <LI>Extension through construction of commandlines from XML.
  <LI>Compiler commands are run directly, not through a shell, which
      is both faster and less liable to cause metacharacter weirdness.
  <LI>Parallel execution of commands, controlled by the <B>-j</B> option.
</UL>

<P>
CANT is written on Mandrake Linux 7.1 on i386 and requires the following,
which should be available on any modern Linux distro:
<UL>
  <LI>GNOME <I>libxml</I> library
  <LI>GNOME <I>glib</I> library
  <LI>POSIX <I>&lt;regex.h&gt;</I>
  <LI>optional: POSIX threads library and <I>&lt;semaphore.h&gt;</I>.
  <LI>to build CANT itself: GNU <I>make</I>.
  <LI>only if you want to help develop CANT: GNU <I>automake</I>.
</UL>

<P>
If you port CANT to a new platform, please EMAILME(mail me) the
patches (unified diff `format' preferred). I will try to incorporate them
into the next release.
</P>
